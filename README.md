* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0077361358
  * * Author: Kenneth S. Saladin
   
  * With Saladin, students engage in the story of anatomy and physiology.
 
  * Memorable stories must be effective in multiple ways. The story must paint a strong visual picture. The story must weave in tools to make the reader remember important events and understand their impact. Ken Saladin weaves graceful descriptions of human anatomy and physiology processes together with carefully selected clinical applications and fascinating stories from the history of medicine and evolutionary medicine to create a multi-layered story about the human body. A consistent set of chapter learning tools helps students identify and retain key concepts while the stunning visual program provides a realistic view of body structures and processes. The fifth edition is further improved by a complete integration of the text with extensive digital teaching and learning tools.
